# Arduino Parking System

## General Description
This project is a Smart Parking System that automates parking lot management using IoT components. 
The system detects vehicle presence, verifies authorized access via NFC, controls gate operations, and monitors parking space occupancy. 
It provides real-time feedback through an LCD display and ensures only authorized vehicles can enter when spaces are available.
